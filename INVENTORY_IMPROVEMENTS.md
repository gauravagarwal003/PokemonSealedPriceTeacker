# Inventory Management Improvements

## What Was Fixed

The original sell/open functionality had several critical issues:

### Previous Problems:
1. **No Inventory Validation**: Could sell/open items you didn't actually have
2. **No Quantity Aggregation**: Each purchase was treated separately, couldn't combine quantities
3. **All-or-Nothing Operations**: Had to sell/open entire purchase records
4. **No Proper Tracking**: No way to see total available quantities across purchases

### New Features Implemented:

## 1. Inventory Aggregation System
- **Function**: `get_inventory_summary()`
- **Purpose**: Aggregates all purchases by product ID to show total quantities
- **Tracks**: 
  - Total purchased
  - Sealed available (can be sold/opened)
  - Opened quantity (still owned but opened)
  - Sold quantity (no longer owned)

## 2. Quantity Validation
- **Function**: `get_available_quantity(product_id, include_opened=False)`
- **Purpose**: Validates that sufficient quantities exist before selling/opening
- **Prevents**: Selling more items than you actually own

## 3. Enhanced Inventory View
- **Function**: `view_inventory()`
- **Features**:
  - Shows aggregated quantities by product
  - Displays sealed/opened/sold breakdown
  - Summary totals
  - Clean, tabular format

## 4. Improved Sell Function
- **Function**: `sell_product()` (completely rewritten)
- **New Features**:
  - Shows aggregated inventory before selling
  - Allows partial quantity sales
  - Validates available quantities
  - FIFO (First In, First Out) processing
  - Splits purchase records when needed
  - Calculates average purchase price for profit/loss
  - Can sell both sealed and opened items

## 5. Improved Open Function
- **Function**: `open_product()` (completely rewritten)
- **New Features**:
  - Shows only sealed items available to open
  - Allows partial quantity opening
  - Validates sealed quantities only
  - FIFO processing for fairness
  - Splits purchase records when needed
  - **Removes opened items from collection market value**

## 6. Market Value Logic Update
- **Opened Items Exclusion**: Opened Pokemon products are excluded from market value calculations
- **Reasoning**: Opened sealed products have little to no resale value
- **Impact**: Collection value charts only reflect sealed items
- **Tracking**: Opened items still tracked for cost basis but not market value

## 6. Smart Record Management
- **Automatic Record Splitting**: When selling/opening partial quantities
- **FIFO Processing**: Oldest items processed first
- **Status Tracking**: Maintains proper sealed/opened/sold status
- **Data Integrity**: Preserves all purchase history
- **Market Value Logic**: Only sealed items contribute to collection value

## Example Scenarios Now Supported:

### Scenario 1: Multiple Purchases, Partial Sale
- Buy 3 ETBs on 2024-01-01
- Buy 2 ETBs on 2024-02-01  
- Sell 4 ETBs on 2024-03-01
- **Result**: System sells 3 from first purchase + 1 from second purchase

### Scenario 2: Partial Opening
- Have 5 Booster Boxes (total value: 5 × market price)
- Open 2 of them
- **Result**: 3 sealed (3 × market price) + 2 opened (no market value)
- **Collection Value**: Reduced by 2 × market price

### Scenario 3: Mixed Sales
- Have 3 sealed + 2 opened ETBs
- Market value reflects only 3 sealed ETBs
- Can sell all 5, but only sealed ones had market value
- **Result**: System handles both sealed and opened items for sales

## Data Structure Changes:

### Added Columns to my_purchases.csv:
- `status`: NULL (sealed), 'OPENED', or 'SOLD'
- `sell_price`: Price per unit when sold
- `sell_date`: Date item was sold

### Automatic Backward Compatibility:
- Works with existing CSV files
- Adds missing columns as needed
- Handles both `dateReceived` and old `purchase_date` columns

## Usage:

1. **View Inventory**: Option 3 in main menu - shows current quantities
2. **Open Products**: Option 4 - validates and allows partial opens
3. **Sell Products**: Option 5 - validates and allows partial sales

## Benefits:

✅ **Accurate Inventory Tracking**: Always know exactly what you own
✅ **Flexible Operations**: Partial sales/opens supported
✅ **Data Integrity**: Complete purchase history preserved
✅ **User-Friendly**: Clear displays and validation messages
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing data
✅ **Financial Accuracy**: Proper profit/loss calculations using average costs

The system now provides professional-grade inventory management for Pokemon sealed product collections!
